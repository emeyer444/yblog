				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>My name is Ernest Meyer, and this is my private site. I was going to be 
				sitting some courses at my local University, Chico State, but its 
				<A TARGET="_BLANK" href='https://rce.csuchico.edu/eldercollege'>Elder's Program</a> 
				has closed due to COVID until Spring  2022. 
				Now I am working on a 3D model of Chatham House in the 
				<a TARGET="_BLANK" href='https://www.stowe.co.uk/'>Stowe School Grounds</a>. Also, a fellow from 
				<a TARGET="_BLANK" href='https://www.ccc.ox.ac.uk/'>Corpus Christi College (Oxford University, UK)</a>  
				is helping me set up a <a href='https://yofiel.com/img/prize3.jpg'>Philosophy of Science Prize.</a></p>

				<p><b>Gun-Control Work Status</b>. This started in 2015, when I asked 300 members of the newly reformed 
					Tea Party if they'd shoot someone for stealing apples from an appletree in their back yard. And ~90% said 
					they would, regardless whether it was only a child. In a few years, I could be resuming 
					<a href="https://yofiel.com/2a.php">my work for the Administration</a> 
					again, now under Biden. But I'm praying Biden's gun-control initiatives of June 2021 will mean I won't have to. 
					Before Biden's speech on it (see the NYT report 
					<a TARGET="_BLANK" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/06/23/us/joe-biden-news">here</a>), The NRA-ILA started fighting it 
					already (see <a TARGET="_BLANK" href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20210609/doj-releases-biden-gun-confiscation-order-legislation">here</a>).
